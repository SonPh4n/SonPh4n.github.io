        <h1>Information About Cute Cats</h1>

        <p>
            When you own a cat, you must understand their needs and wants especially when it comes to taking care of them.
            Depending on the breed of cat, you may experience more or less shedding fur which is why you need to regularly groom it.
            Additionally you should consider purchasing a scratching post to promote healthy claws.
            Not to mention that your cat should be fed high quality foods for a better life!
